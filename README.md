# AECO AI Strategy Canvas

A strategic decision-support tool designed to help architecture, engineering, construction, and operations leaders prioritize applied AI investments with clarity and discipline.

This is not a demo chatbot. It is a structured strategy framework that translates AI capabilities into ranked, outcome-driven recommendations using transparent scoring logic.

## What This Tool Does

The AECO AI Strategy Canvas evaluates:

- Industry segment  
- Digital maturity level  
- Strategic objective  

It then applies a weighted scoring model to identify and rank high-impact AI use cases across planning, design, construction, and operations.

The output includes:

- Prioritized AI initiatives  
- ROI-weighted scoring logic  
- Implementation complexity indicators  
- A phased roadmap (Immediate, Mid-Term, Long-Term)  

The goal is to help executive teams move from AI exploration to disciplined portfolio decisions.

## Why This Exists

AI in AECO is shifting from experimentation to operational impact. Most firms struggle with:

- Fragmented AI initiatives  
- Unclear ROI prioritization  
- Misalignment between digital maturity and ambition  
- Hype-driven investment decisions  

This tool demonstrates how structured strategy, not hype, should drive AI investment.

## Strategic Framework

The ranking engine uses a weighted model:

- 40% Strategic Objective Alignment  
- 30% Digital Maturity Fit  
- 30% Base ROI / Value Potential  

The methodology is intentionally transparent to support executive-level conversations.
